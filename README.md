# ezlang :ok_hand:

Simple language developed to practice implementing lexical scopes.

## What we have here?

### Higher order functions

```
val id = func (a) {
  a
}
```
Result of a function is the last expression inside it's body.

### Condition expressions

```
val amIHappy(myAge) {
  if myAge == 17 then 1 else 0
}
```
